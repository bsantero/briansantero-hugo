<img class="pure-img float-left pad-left portfolio-img-right" src="/images/Tonality-thumbnail.png" />Ah, Tonality. My first. It's not exactly how I'd like to leave it, it could be improved, but what can't? Maybe Neil DeGrasse Tyson, he's perfect. Anyways, Tonality is a collaboration with fellow programmer [Kai Cataldo](http://kai.codes) who has been a great colleague, sounding board, and genuinely great guy. Go check out his stuff, he's got great ideas (Tonality being one) and hopefully you can see the Dr. Jekyll to my Mr. Hyde.

Tonality is a fun loop generator, albeit not extremely powerful, but extremely entertaining. There have been raves powered by Tonality*, or so I hear from the Twittersphere. HTML, CSS, JS, baby, it's simple, fun and addictive. Oh yeah, fun trivia: the default sound pack (alternate sound packs in a future update) is a pentatonic scale meaning there are no dissonant notes. Everything sounds good! Love physics.

Leave a comment, question, or genuine praise up at the top and we'll give you a holla back!

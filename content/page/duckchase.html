<h1>Why you's guys?</h1>

At DuckChase we'll do nearly everything for you as long as it involves bits and bytes. We love the digitization of information including music, voiceovers, video production, and the web. Everything you see and hear on Brian's site is a product of our own (lack-of?) imagination and blood, sweat,[^1] and tears (mostly tears).

<h1>So, how do I Duckchase?</h1>

If you'd like to figure out your options, drop us a [little line](/contact/) and we'll make it happen!
